# Snake game done in Pygame

The video is a bit laggy - it's not a feature of the game!

Art and music made by me.
Death sound and the the sound of getting an apple were made using: https://sfxr.me/

----------

I'm not very proud of how the code is laid out - it's very messy. I tried to divide it into more files but I failed miserably - it became even more messier than before. In the end most of the code is located in single file (main.py)  

  
**BUG WARNING!**  
If you change directions to quickly it's possible to do a 180 degree turn during one frame which results in collsion with yourself and death.
